# Golang TP Link HS1xx Plug Library

# What?

A Golang library to access the TP Link HS1xx Plugs.  It implements a subset of available commands and for a large part returns all the provided data it does though also add additional data into the returned documents.

# Status?

Only basic commands are implemented based on my needs - the full command list can be found in COMMANDS.txt and we might look at supporting more in time.  For now this is enough to build basic management tools.
